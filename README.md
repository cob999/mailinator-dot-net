THIS IS NOT COMPLETE

I was in communications with Mailinator to get a trial account. This was about 3 weeks ago and I haven't heard from them since. Since I have no reference to work with except the documentation on their website I don't really know what the returned objects are. 

I've build the skeleton for this to work. My hope is to make this into a nuget package that can be used by projects. Unfortunately without an account I can't try anything.

I welcome anyone who does have access to create a PR to help me complete this. 

Enjoy.
